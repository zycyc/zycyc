## 🧠 About Me

I am a PhD student specializing in computational cognitive neuroscience. My research focuses on developing neural network models to study learning and memory in humans and AI agents. My interests include reinforcement learning, continual learning, and meta-learning.

As a self-taught engineer, I am driven by curiosity and a passion for expanding my technical expertise. I enjoy contributing to the open-source community by building applications that leverage my understanding of machine learning models. I feel rewarded by feedback from the community and opportunities to meet more fellows and expand my tech stack.
